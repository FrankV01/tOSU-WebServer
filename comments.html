		<h1>Welcome</h1>
		<p>Welcome to my Web Server project. I hope you have a great visit.
		This document contains some quick notes on building and running the
		programs.</p>
		
		<h2>Compiling</h2>
		<p>A build can be accomplished one of two ways. The first is manually
		running <code>javac</code> the second is to use <code>ant</code>. The
		two methods are outlined below.</p>
		
		<h3>javac</h3>
		<p>The is a single file that must be compiled Any dependencies
		should be compiled inherently.</p>
		
		<p>The file is:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><code>WebServer.java</code> </li>
		</ul>
		
		<p>To compile the file and all related files, simply issue the following
		command:</p>
		
		<ul>
			<li><code>javac WebServer.java</code></li>
		</ul>
			
		<h3>Ant [<em>Optional</em>]</h3>
		
		<p><strong>If you desire</strong>, you can try to use <a href="http://ant.apache.org/">ant</a>
		to build the files. Using ant saves some typing but it truly isn't
		required.</p>
		
		<p>I've provided a build file called <code>build.xml</code>. Simply
		point your command window to the directory you unzipped the files at.
		And then execute <code>ant</code>. A basic build will be done and the
		resulting class files will be stored in &quot;build&quot;.</p>
		
		<p>Further ant build options can be explored via the <code>ant
		-projecthelp</code> command. This will simply list all build targets
		but the default is the most commonly used one.</p>
		
		<h2>Running the Web Server</h2>
		<p>Execution of the program is very simple and straight forward. There are 
		some command line options and those are laid out below along with 
		the default values. <strong>The web server, by default, runs on port <code>2540</code>
		as required by the assignment.</strong></p>
		
		<p>For simplicity's sake, here are some example executions along with an explanation</p>
		<table border="1" cellpadding="1" cellspacing="1">
			<tr style="background-color:lightgray;font-weight:bold;">
				<th>Start up Command</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>java WebServer</code></td>
				<td><p>Most simplistic execution. Starts a web server serving files
				from the directory that the class file resides in. No debugging information
				is outputted.</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>java WebServer -l</code></td>
				<td><p>Start the sever in Listener mode. This uses MyListener.java</p></td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>java WebServer -d -f=../pages</code></td>
				<td><p>Start the web server with debug mode enabled. For files, look
				one directory back in another directory called pages.</p></td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		
		<h3>The complete command line option descriptions</h3>
		
		<table border="1" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="1">
			<tr style="background-color:lightgray;font-weight:bold;">
				<th>Command Switch</th>
				<th>Command Name</th>
				<th>Default</th>
				<th>Description</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>-?</code></td>
				<td>Help</td>
				<td>N/A</td>
				<td>Lists the programs optional switches and a bit of information
					on how to use the program.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>-p</code></td>
				<td>Server Port</td>
				<td>2540</td>
				<td>The port to serve from.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>-d</code></td>
				<td>Enable Debug Mode</td>
				<td>Off</td>
				<td>Enable debug mode which simply prints out more detailed status
					messages.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>-l</code></td>
				<td>MyListener</td>
				<td>Off</td>
				<td>Execute the server utilizing the MyListener.java class file. This turns
				the server in to the Client Lister which was used to gather the client output.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td><code>-f</code></td>
				<td>Serve-From-Directory</td>
				<td><code>.</code> (e.g. the current directory)</td>
				<td>This is the directory from which the HTML file to serve come from. The default
				is the directory the server is running from. You can use either relative or absolute
				paths with this option. <br /><br />As an option, to serve files from C:\wwwroot\pages\
				you'd use the option as: <code>-f=C:\wwwroot\pages</code>.<br /> Start up checks are performed
				to loosely validate the input.</td>
			</tr>

		<h2>Turned In</h2>
		<p>You should find all require peice in the archive. The following is a couple of notes
		on the items I've turned in. </p>
		<p>The output-captures (in the output-captures folder) include three items. The http-streams.txt file is
		as request -- a combination of all the different streams gathered to assemble the web server.</p>
		<p>The two output files contain server outputs from actual runs but serveing two different directires.
		The <strong>webserver-output.txt</strong> was a ran with the pages directory which is included
		with this archive as an example. The <strong>javadocs-folder-output.txt</strong> file contains
		output from the server while serving the auto-generated javadoc folder (produced via <code>ant doc</code>.
		The javadocs folder contains many more requests as there are more files.</p>
