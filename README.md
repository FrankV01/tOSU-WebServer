# tOSU-WebServer
An educational web server implemented in Java.

This was a grad-school project I completed some years ago now. It's posted for those that might want to see a simple, HTTP web server. Most folks see Apache and conclud web servers are some complex beasts. And they are -- but they don't have to be. The princples behind a web service --tried and true, are actually quite simple. This example is documented and serves HTML files and images. 

# Status
This is "complete" in that I don't intend to make significat changes to it such as adding features. If someone finds a typo or makes improvements, I will of course, accept pull requests.

If you need help getting it running or run in to something, open an issue and I will help you as best as I can.
