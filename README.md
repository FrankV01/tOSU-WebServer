# tOSU-WebServer
An educational web server implemented in Java.

This was a grad-school project I completed some years ago now. It's posted for those that might want to see a simple, HTTP web server. Most folks see Apache and conclud web servers are some complex beasts. And they are -- but they don't have to be. The princples behind a web service --tried and true, are actually quite simple. This example is documented and serves HTML files and images. 

# Getting started
Check out the comments.html file which has information on Compiling and ant.

# Status
This is "complete" in that I don't intend to make significat changes to it such as adding features. If someone finds a typo or makes improvements, I will of course, accept pull requests.

That said, this project is old.... I haven't ran it in some time and keep it here mainly for others' review and posterity. I'm not sure how compatable it is with the latest Java version. Again though, pull requests are accepted and should you point something out, I will take the tiem to fix it.

If you need help getting it running or run in to something, open an issue and I will help you as best as I can.
